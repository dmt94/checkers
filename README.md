##### (SOME) FUTURE APP FEATURES:
- As a player, having an option for a 2 player game or a game against a computer would be fun, because it give a more well-rounded gameplay experience.

###### Architecture and Challenges

- ###### Classes  
  - A majority of the code is written using classes, taking advantage of encapsulation.
    - Personally, it was easier to follow the flow of the game when the variables involved are encapsulated into specific methods belonging to classes
- ###### Bugs
  - Fixing bugs took a majority of the project time. It was challenging to reproduce a particular bug in my game where a glitch would occur if another checker piece was clicked during a player's turn.

##### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

- As a player, having an option for a 2 player game or a game against a computer would be fun, because it give a more well-rounded gameplay experience.

- A day/night mode button toggle because it would be beneficial to me if I experience eye strain.

- Be able to pick different pieces on the main menu would be a fun addition
